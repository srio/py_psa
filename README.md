# py_psa X-ray Phase Space Analysis in Python

Implementation of the Phase Space Method for computing X-ray beamline parameters. 

The code follows the ideas in these papers: 

- C. Ferrero, D.-M. Smiglies, C. Riekel, G. Gatta and P. Daly, "Extending the possibilities in
phase space analysis of synchrotron radiation x-ray optics", Applied optics/Vol.47, No.22/ 1 August 2008.

- J.S. Pedersen and C. Riekel, "Resolution Function and Flux at the Sample for Small-Angle X-
ray Scattering Calculated in Position-Angle-Wavelength Space, Journal of Applied Crystallography
24, 893-909 (1991)
https://doi.org/10.1107/S0021889891003692

This code is a python implementation of the original Mathematica+TclTk code.
